\section{The laziness manifesto}

\subsection{First: Be awesome}



\begin{frame}{or at least pretend..}{}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Don't rush to broke what is already \texttt{working}.
  \pause
  \item
    Better sluggishly embrace with a stunning overfunctionality to ultimately kill what you hate. 
  \pause
\item
    When is not posible decouple to smartly extend, build over the top with a big layer of pilow  and by the end rest in the top.
  \pause
\item
    Gain confidence around and fear from the communers by doing what is aparently another level supernatural vodoo-hacker mojo while you are actually slacking off.   
  \pause
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Complexity of the absurd}{Not stupid if it works...}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Don't stop after \alert{automatize}  what everyone think makes sense.
  \pause
  \item
    Connect the dots where there is any dot in sight or make your own dots by force, use a gun if you need it. 
  \pause
\item
    Creativity from laziness is a bless, don't forget.
  \end{itemize}
